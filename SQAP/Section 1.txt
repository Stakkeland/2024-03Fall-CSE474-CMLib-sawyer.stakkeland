Section 1
Purpose and Scope

Purpose
This software works as a discord bot that can be added to any discord server. The purpose is to allow 
users to click a join button on a certain 'Call of Duty' title. This will then add the user to a pool of
other users. Once 8 users are in the pool, the players are added to a private voice lobby, where teams
and maps are assigned to help facilitate creating private competitive lobbies on legacy titles. This is
due to the fact that legacy titles do not contain competitive playlists in matchmaking.

Scope
The bot will be expected to be added to a few discord servers that contain a large plethora of 'Call of
Duty' competitive fans. The known issues that may arise are moving users to lobbies and ensuring the 
bot remains stable with large quantities of people clicking join at the same time.
